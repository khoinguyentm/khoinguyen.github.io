          <h3>Original Product</h3>

            "Basketball Blueprint" is an assistant tool for basketball coaches,
            the app has a total of 135+ drill, on-court demonstration videos,
            clipboard, practice builder, and 41+ strategies in playbook
            included.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here are the problems: the app looks outdated, very limited
            access on free version, navigation is puzzling, and you actually
            have to pay $28.99 just for the clipboard. If you decide to keep the
            free trial, you have to pay $4.99 to unlock each additional drills
            and practice ideas.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Research Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I encountered a challenging moment in the begining of my research:
            finding a specific amount of people with insight of coaching. I
            needed to target coaches that use mobile apps to support their
            coaching career and ask about how they feel about “Basketball
            Blueprint”, and expanded my research to any experience of coaching
            and users who played sports at any level.
          </p>

          <h3>User Persona</h3>
          <p>
            When I created my first persona, I realised that persona was a
            highly experienced high school basketball coach. I decided to focus
            on Mitchell, he used to play in NJB (National Junior Basketball) and
            now he's currently coaching a NJB team.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Mitchell needs is an accessible app for quick and effective
            coaching ideas, and he wants to level up his coaching experience to
            coach better.

          <h3>Interview Results For "Basketball Blueprint"</h3>
          <p>
            The results came back to me and I did not surprise. 100% of people
            said that the app looks outdated, they didn't understand what
            "Blueprint" means in sports like basketball, logo doesn't make
            sense, icons are not eye-catching, hard to navigate, nobody wanted
            to pay $28.99 for just unlock the clipboard, and very limited access
            for free trial.

          <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            During my competitor analysis, I discovered that "CoachBase" is a
            redesign brand of "Basketball coach's clipboard". Their product
            became a powerful tool and it designed by coaches for coaches. The
            app features high quality drill videos, smart and easy to understand
            clipboard animations, intuitive design, automatic timer, and the app
            is world wide. On the other hand, "Youtube" and other experienced
            coaches are my indirect competitors. During my research I learned
            that people go to "Youtube" to learn and research plays or drills,
            and they would find some experienced coaches to ask for advices.

          <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            From my collected data from user interviews, I created 2 affinity
            diagrams to organize and generate ideas. These 2 affinity diagram
            (below) shows my findings during my user interviews. I interviewed a
            total 4 people that have coaching experience on different levels or
            interest in coaching. I discovered that none of them are using
            coaching app or don’t like to use it because of many reasons: never
            heard of the app, upgrade plan is expensive not worth it, hidden
            upgrade features, and it’s frustrated to use.
          </p>

        <img src="./coachingUp/img/affinity2.png" id="pic" />
        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <p>
            From there I made I Like, I Wish, What If and learned that if users
            would download and use the app, they would like to share their
            drills with other coaches, a brand new interface, and a full access
            for trial base for a specific amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end I made a priorities matrix where I sorted high impact and
            high priority, low impact and low priority. I finalized the results
            in 4 very important and challenging solutions (show below) to work
            on.
