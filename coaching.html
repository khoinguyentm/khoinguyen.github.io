          <h3>Project Summary</h3>
          <p>
            This is an individual project while attending UX/UI Bootcamp at UCI,
            with the goals of practicing and developing myself as a professional
            in UX/UI world. I focused heavily on the UI and created quick & easy
            navigation for user experience for this project . Thanks for the
            <a

            that helped me a lot to go step by step and achieveing to have a
            good final solution.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Time organization for this project:</strong></p>
          <p>Day 1: User research + UI analysis</p>
          <p>Day 2: Definition & ideation</p>
          <p>Day 3: UI paper prototyping + wireframing</p>
          <p>Day 4: UI style guide + mid-fidelity prototyping</p>
          <p>Day 5: UI testing</p>

          <h3>Original Product</h3>

            "Basketball Blueprint" is an assistant tool for basketball coaches,
            the app has a total of 135+ drill, on-court demonstration videos,
            clipboard, practice builder, and 41+ strategies in playbook
            included.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here are the problems: the app looks outdated, limited access on
            trial version, navigation is puzzling, and you actually have to pay
            $28.99 just for the clipboard. If you decided to keep the free
            trial, you have to pay $4.99 to unlock each additional drills and
            practice ideas.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Research Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I encountered a challenging moment in the begining of my research:
            finding a specific amount of people with insight of coaching. I
            needed to target coaches that use mobile apps to support their
            coaching career and ask about how they feel about “Basketball
            Blueprint”, and expanded my research to any experience of coaching
            and users who played sports at any level.
          </p>

          <h3>User Persona</h3>
          <p>
            When I created my first persona, I realised that persona was a
            highly experienced high school basketball coach. I decided to focus
            on Mitchell, he used to play in NJB (National Junior Basketball) and
            now he's currently coaching a NJB team.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Mitchell needs is an accessible app for quick and effective
            coaching ideas, and he wants to level up his coaching experience.

          <h3>Interview Results For "Basketball Blueprint"</h3>
          <p>
            The results came back to me and I did not surprise. 100% of people
            said that the app looks outdated, they didn't understand what
            "Blueprint" means in sports like basketball, logo doesn't make
            sense, icons are not eye-catching, hard to navigate, nobody wanted
            to pay $28.99 for just unlock the clipboard, and very limited access
            for free trial.

          <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            During my competitor analysis, I discovered that "CoachBase" is a
            redesign brand of "Basketball coach's clipboard". Their product
            became a powerful tool and it designed by coaches for coaches. The
            app features high quality drill videos, smart and easy to understand
            clipboard animations, intuitive design, automatic timer, and the app
            is world wide. On the other hand, "Youtube" and other experienced
            coaches are my indirect competitors. During my research I learned
            that people go to "Youtube" to learn and research plays or drills,
            and they would find some experienced coaches to ask for advices.
          </p>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            From my collected data from user interviews, I created 2 affinity
            diagrams to organize and generate ideas. I interviewed a total 4
            people that have coaching experience on different levels or interest
            in coaching. I discovered that none of them are using coaching app
            or don’t like to use it because of many reasons: never heard of the
            app, upgrade plan is expensive not worth it, hidden upgrade
            features, and it’s frustrated to use.
          </p>

        <img src="./coachingUp/img/affinity.png" id="pic" />
        <img src="./coachingUp/img/affinity2.png" id="pic" />
        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <p>
            From there I made I Like, I Wish, What If and learned that if users
            would download and use the app, they would like to share their
            drills with other coaches, a brand new interface, and a full access
            for trial base for a specific amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end I made a priorities matrix where I sorted high impact and
            high priority, low impact and low priority. I finalized the results
            in 4 very important and challenging solutions (show below) to work
            on.

        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h3>Logo Redesign</h3>
          <p>
            I changed the brand name because the app was designed and was
            targeted only for coaches. I wanted a universal name for the app
            because there's not just "Basketball Blueprint", there are "Baseball
            Blueprint", "Soccer Blueprint", and "Football Blueprint". So with
            the universal brand name, an expansion version of the app to across
            more than one sports in the future would be very helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the logo part, I started with a simple "C", played around with
            colors, and then worked my way up with font styles and arrows. The
            reason behind 2 up arrows was an inspiration by leveling up in video
            games and rankings in military. The whistle represents coaches at
            any sports.

          <h2>Testing & Iterations</h2>
          <h3>Low-FI & Mid-FI</h3>
          <p>
            After countless a/b testings, user testings, and designing. I
            finally came up with the final version of low-fidelity wireframe.
            After that, the mid-fidelity versions was where I input the colors,
            and the layout for the app. Through repetitive design, a/b, and user
            testing, I finished my project with the Invision prototype.
