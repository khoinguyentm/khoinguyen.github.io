        <h2>Overall Concept</h2>
        <h3>Mappy's Background</h3>
        <p>
          Over a 3 week time span, I collaborated with two other UX and UI
          designers to research, design, and test MappyHour, a time and money
          saving mobile app for happy hour enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem & Solution</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> There are currently very few apps that
          features happy hour for people who wants to enjoy outing, but don't
          want to empty their wallets, and these apps have limited resources for
          happy hour in the user's surrounding areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Solution:</strong> How do we fix this? My team and I had
          decided to create an app to give users flexibility in finding happy
          hour deals nearby by sharing their location and allowing them to
          filter their search such as time, cuisines, pricing, etc.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="caseStudy">
        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h2>Design Process: Research</h2>
          <h3>Interview & Survey</h3>
          <p>
            Through user interviews and survey methods, we gathered insight from
            twenty-eight men and women between the age of 21 to 45 years old to
            learn more about their general social habits, opinions, and
            behaviors.
          </p>

          <h3>User Insight</h3>
          <p>
            During the interviews, we discovered that food and drinks are the
            priority for socializing. People also like to spend time with family
            or friends at their regular hangout spots, but they’re still open
            for suggestions to new places.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, we believe that happy hour/special deals for food and
            drinks will make outing more exciting, and make the gathering more
            enjoyable for people in their social experience. We might be able to
            help if we create an app that can locate happy hour/special deals in
            the user's area with specific details about the place.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do this by letting users use their current location to search for
            happy hour/special deals, and then show them a full list of choices.
          </p>

          <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            After our interviews, we gathered and analyzed answers. From there,
            we created an affinity diagram (shown below). This diagram helped us
            understand what features users expect to have in the app. These
            features are: the happy hour menu, offers, and when the happy
            hour/special deals starts and ends.

          <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
          <p>
            Our next step in this project was to create an empathy map (below).
            This empathy map showed us the pains and the gains of our users. Our
            findings:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <p>Pains:</p>
            <li>Picky eaters & dietary restrictions.</li>
            <li>Work conflicts with happy hour times.</li>
            <li>Times & pricing = main considerations.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <p>Gains:</p>
            <li>Spending time with friends and family.</li>
            <li>Becoming a regular to get to know people and places.</li>

          <p>
            Our main focus in this project was Tom Smith. Tom is 26 years old,
            he's currently working as a flooring salesman. He was in search of
            special deals at restaurants or places that offer happy hour because
            he wants to socialize but also stay within his budget.

          <h3>I like, I wish, What if… & Feature Prioritization Matrix</h3>
          <p>
            We used the I like, I wish, What if… method and feature
            prioritization matrix for brainstorming and ideating the key
            features of our app. We decided that our app should include these
            key features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What time to go out?</li>
            <li>Being able to see the menu beforehand.</li>
            <li>Restaurant, traffic, and the busiest times.</li>
            <li>Finding the best deals near me.</li>
            <li>
              Restaurant's ability to promote or advertise new deals to users.

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            Next step of our research process was user flow. We used this user
            flow (below) to focus on experiences while we were testing. Also,
            this user flow aided us in documenting the design process and the
            work user interaction points.

            After creating user journey, we found a few opportunities for app
            improvement. The task at hand is to create an account with email and
            browse happy hour deals nearby.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <p>Opportunities for improvement:</p>
            <li>
              Include onboarding and an option to either create an account or
              continue as a guest.

            <li>Option to browse nearby without actually starting a search.</li>
            <li>
              Deal-of-the-day restaurants that offer extra points for checking
              in or making reservations through the app (opportunity for ROI).

            <li>
              Indicate parking options at the location (valet, parking garage,

          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            For our competitor, we discovered that "The House" maps out happy
            hour deals in surrounding areas, detail about happy hour time and
            prices, and a variety of choices between food and drinks. The app is
            easy to use but usually crash/freeze while in use, some places have
            no real offer value, and only provides five different locations in
            United States.

            <li>Combine search and filter together</li>
            <li>Shrink the hamburger menu icon</li>
            <li>Provide option to view search results on a map</li>
            <li>
              Add a time chart to visually display the rush hour at a restaurant
              each day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the ability to go to the Uber or Lyft apps to call a ride to
              the restaurant address.

          <h2>Future Thinking & Development</h2>
          <p>
            For future improvement, the app could provide both users and
            businesses utilization of the app by offering exclusive deals to
            users from restaurants in their area and marketing opportunities for
            restaurants to advertise on the app. Also, expand more search
            results and give discounts on Uber/Lyft rides for those who use the
            app often.
