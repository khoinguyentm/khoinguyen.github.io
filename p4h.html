          <h3>What is Paws 4 Healing?</h3>
          <p>
            Paws 4 Healing is an all volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit
            organization in southern California. Their volunteer teams provide
            animal-assisted activity and animal-assisted therapy services for
            healthcare facilities, schools, and other kinds of social agencies.

          <h2>Problem & Solution</h2>
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            The original website has an outdated design that takes away from the
            credibility of the Paws 4 Healing. My team believe redesigning the
            "paws 4 healing" website to be more accessible, flexible, and
            credible for volunteers, members and general public will achieve
            increase engagement with the community and donations for the cause

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The goal for this project was recreate Paws 4 Healingâ€™s branding and
            introduce simple user flows with modern design, also create
            responsive for smart devices.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Survey Results</h3>
          <p>
            During my research phase with two other designers we did in-person
            interviews, survey, and eventually we got a hold of the stakeholder.
            Base on the survey, our participants are mostly mid career working
            professional and they don't have a lot of time for volunteer but
            they do have a lot of resources to donate. After collecting the
            results, we analyzed the data using multiple techniques.

          <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            From our in-person interview results. We analyzed the answers and
            information from our participants and created a affinity diagram
            (below). The affinity diagram shed keys insights into our research
            findings and allowed us to easily extract valuable information.

          <h3>User Persona</h3>
          <p>
            The affinity diagram illustrated above helped create the user
            persona (below) for this project. The user persona was a helpful
            tools throughout the design process and bridge the gap between
            research and planning. In this project we focused on Susan, a
            college student.

          <h3>Susan's Journey Map</h3>
          <p>
            The user journey displays a typical process that involves scheduling
            a pet therapy event for Susan's school. We created the map to
            empathize with Susan and to showcase Susan's emotions, thoughts and
            actions during her scheduling process. We ultimately extracted key
            points, Susan's needs and pain points.

          <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            While we were working on our analysis, we thought that "Pet
            Partners" were going to be our main competitor but when we talked to
            the stakeholder turned out they are partners and every action is
            through "Pet Partners". People contact "Pet Partners" and they
            transfer them to "Paws 4 Healing" based on their location. "Love 4
            Paws" and "UCI Health" are our competitors, specify in having people
            volunteer to be handlers and bringing their animals but not so much
            for scheduling a therapy.

          <h3>SWOT</h3>
          <p>
            This SWOT analysis (below) on original website we found that they
            did have their own contents they were very explicit about becoming a
            pet handlers and the things that they do. Even with the outdated
            look their navigation structure was decent and everything was layout
            simple.

          <h3>Style Guide</h3>
          <p>
            Below is the style guide that I created. The colors look more
            vibrant, fun and happy. We are using SF Pro Display and Roboto for
            typography to make the website looks more clean and modern. We also
            created button interactions to let user know when the button is
            disabled and when is active.

          <h3>Logo Redesign</h3>
          <p>
            During my logo redesign process, I broke down the meaning of their
            brand. The reason why I chose pink over their yellow is because they
            have a very tight relationship with "Pet Partners" so I designed
            "Paws 4 Healing" looks relative with their partner and then I
            started to add more illustrations to make the logo has more meaning.

          <h2>Prototyping & Testing</h2>
          <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            Through out research and sketching, I landed at the first low
            fidelity wireframes. The task for this wireframe is schedule a pet
            therapy event at a school. Based on desired event location and time,
            Susan can easily schedule her event at her school through simple and
            straight forward scheduling process.

        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h3>Main Takeaway From Testing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow users to mark their favorite animals.</li>
            <li>Design a pending landing page so users can bookmark.</li>
            <li>Pop-up warning when go back while filling forms.</li>
            <li>Stay with color palette.</li>
            <li>Footer needs improve.</li>
            <li>
              Take out the shadow behind logo since the website is flat.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            The links to my prototype below are focusing on shceduling a pet
            therapy event at Susan's school. She wants to schedule on September
            27 at 11am to 3pm.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Design micro-interactions.</li>
            <li>
              Create a search tool users can search their favorite animals based
              on zip code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a tracking page that shows the status of the scheduling
              request.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            I had an amazing time working on this project. I experienced
            branding design, responsive design, and sketch illustrations. I
            thoroughly enjoyed the research and interview process. At this
            point, I am eager to jump into my next project. I delivered a
            consistent, clean, modern look product that solves a real problem
            for Susan and everyone struggling with the original website.
