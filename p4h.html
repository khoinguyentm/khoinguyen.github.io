          <h2>Current Website</h2>
          <p>
            A few months ago, I found a non-profit website while browsing for my
            non-profit redesign project. This website is extremely outdated by
            the looks, the fonts, the responsiveness, and puzzling pet therapy
            booking process.

          <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I ended up getting a hold of the skateholders. They told me that
            their last update was 2012 and they have no interest in redesigning
            the website at this time. I decided to redesign the website anyway
            with no charge and let them know that I will send them the prototype
            for consideration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I came up with a plan and decided to redesign the whole structure of
            the apppearance and functions of this website. I aim to improve the
            user's online experience by making online access readily available.

          <h3>What is Paws 4 Healing?</h3>
          <p>
            "Paws 4 Healing is an all volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit
            organization in southern California. Their volunteer teams provide
            animal-assisted activity and animal-assisted therapy services for
            healthcare facilities, schools, and other kinds of social agencies."

          <h2>Problem & Solution</h2>
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            The original website has an outdated design that takes away from the
            credibility of the Paws 4 Healing. I enhanced the "Paws 4 Healing"
            website by increasing accessibility, flexibility, and credibility
            for volunteers, members, and the general public. This will engage
            the audience more in considering to donate and/or get involved with
            the community.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The goal for this project was to recreate Paws 4 Healing’s branding
            and introduce a much simpler user flow with modern design.
            Consequently, create a prompt responsiveness for smart devices.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Survey Results</h3>
          <p>
            During my research process, I did in-person interviews and sent out
            surveys. Based on the surveys, the participants are mostly
            mid-career, working professionals and they don't have a lot of time
            for volunteer but they do have plenty of resources for donation.
            After collecting the results, I analyzed the data using the multiple
            research techniques.

          <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            From the in-person interview results, I analyzed the answers and
            information from the participants and created an affinity diagram
            (shown below). The affinity diagram shed key insights into my
            research findings and allows me to easily extract valuable
            information.

          <h3>User Persona</h3>
          <p>
            The affinity diagram illustrated above helped create the user
            persona (below) for this project. The user persona was a helpful
            tool throughout the design process and bridge the gap between
            research and planning. In this project I focused on Susan, a college
            student.

          <h3>Susan's Journey Map</h3>
          <p>
            The user journey displays a typical process that involves scheduling
            a pet therapy event for Susan's school. I created the map to
            empathize with Susan and to showcase Susan's emotions, thoughts and
            actions during her scheduling process. I ultimately extracted key
            points, Susan's needs and stress levels.

          <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            While I was working on competitor analysis, I thought that "Pet
            Partners" was going to be the main competitor. However, when I
            talked to the stakeholder it turned out that they are partners and
            every process is done through "Pet Partners". People contact "Pet
            Partners" to get transferred to "Paws 4 Healing" based on their
            location. "Love 4 Paws" and "UCI Health" are main competitors in
            this design project, they're specifically in having people volunteer
            to be handlers and bringing their animals but not so much for
            scheduling a therapy session.

          <h3>Style Guide</h3>
          <p>
            Below is the style guide that I created. The colors look more
            vibrant, joyful, and happy. I chose SF Pro Display and Roboto for
            typography to make the website look more clean and modern. I also
            created button interactions to let users know when the button is
            disabled and when it is active.

          <h3>Logo Redesign</h3>
          <p>
            During my logo redesign process, I broke down the meaning of their
            brand. The reason why I chose pink over their yellow is because they
            have a very tight relationship with "Pet Partners" so I designed
            "Paws 4 Healing" to look relative to their partner and then I added
            more illustrations to make the logo more appealing.

          <h2>Prototyping & Testing</h2>
          <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout my research and sketching, I landed at the first low
            fidelity wireframes. The task for this wireframe is to schedule a
            pet therapy event at a school. Based on the desired event location
            and time, Susan can easily schedule her event at her school through
            a simple and straight-forward scheduling process.

          <h3>Main Takeaway From Testing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow users to mark their favorite animal(s).</li>
            <li>Design a pending landing page so users can bookmark.</li>
            <li>Pop-up warning when going back while filling forms.</li>
            <li>Stay with color palette.</li>
            <li>Footer needs improvement.</li>
            <li>
              Take out the shadow behind logo since the website is flat.

          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            The links to my prototype below are focusing on scheduling a pet
            therapy event at Susan's school. She wants to schedule on September
            27 from 11am to 3pm.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Design micro-interactions.</li>
            <li>
              Create a search tool that users can search for their favorite
              animals based on zip code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a tracking page that shows the status of the scheduling
              request.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            By accomplishing this new and improved website, I experienced
            branding design, responsive design, and sketch illustrations. I
            thoroughly enjoyed the research and interview process. I delivered a
            consistent, clean, modern look to the website that solved a real
            problem for Susan and everyone struggling with the original website.
            At this point, I am eager to jump into my next project.
