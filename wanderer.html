        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <p>
            When I first started my career as a UX/UI designer, I was given a
            great opportunity to challenge my UX/UI skills and explore travel
            industry. The task was design a travel app that helps international
            travelers solve their inability of choosing a right packaged travel
            deal, managing their trips, and searching for activities of the
            place they visit.
          </p>
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            For this project, I needed to target travelers who are wanting to
            save money and time during their booking, and also willing to
            discover popular activities at the destinations that they visit.
          </p>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <h3>My Design Process</h3>
          <img src="./wanderer/img/Process.png" width="100%" />
          <p>
            Every idea or wireframe is frequently tested by myself if I find any
            problem or solution I will need to bring it back to the Ideation
            phase to sketch out the flow and solution on a piece of paper.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h3>The Background</h3>
          <p>
            Wanderer was designed to help international travelers support their
            wanderlust by providing individualized packaged travel deals
            including activities available at their fingertips.
          </p>

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Many travelers around the world needs a resource that provides all
            of the essential information about a destination and travel deals
            because it is time consuming to sort through multiple different
            sources of information.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Wanderer will focus on fully packaged travel deals and things to do
            when visiting a new destination but will less concerned about "must
            eat" places because there are already many apps that fill this need.
            In addition, users have the ability to share their trips and mark
            their favorite destinations or activities.

          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <h3>Research Questions Asked To Users</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How often do you travel?</li>
            <li>How do you plan your trip/travel?</li>
            <li>How much time do you typically spend on planning a trip?</li>
            <li>Ever used any mobile app or web app to plan your trip?</li>
            <li>Why you prefer using that app?</li>
            <li>When you travel, what kind of activities do you prefer?</li>
            <li>Would you choose a full travel package deal?</li>

          <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            According to my plan I was supposed to interview 5 people, but I
            could only able to grab 3 at a local Starbuck shop. After gathering
            and analyzing their answers and information, I created a affinity
            diagram (below). This process allowed me to find more insights and
            ideas in order to design the best solution.

          <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
          <p>
            I created this empathy map (below) to continue to deeper empathize
            with my user. Doing this helped me understand thoughts and feelings
            of what was going on with my user. In this project I focused on
            Wayne, an experienced programmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wayne’s goals are taking his girlfriend to vaction at least once a
            year and discovering the uniqueness and authenticities of every
            place he visits to fulfill his wanderlust characteristic.

          <p>
            Wayne’s persona will give me more insight on his goals,
            frustrations, and background to build a fitting travel application
            for him and many others in need of a travel plan.

          <p>
            This is one of the most powerful tool that I used to collect
            feedbacks from Wayne during my interview with him. After analyzed
            collected information, I started my brainstorming session to help me
            generate ideas for the app.

            structure.

          <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            During my competitor analysis, I discovered that "Gravy Events"
            became a huge resource for users to find nearby events and "Tripit"
            did an amazing job at allowing users to manage their trips and also
            sharing their trips with others. Their designs are visually
            appealing and easy-to-use applications.

          <p>
            A picture is worth a thousand words. I created this storyboard
            (below) so that I could visually predict and explore Wayne's
            experience with "Wanderer". It gave me a clear sense of what's
            really important for him in my design.

            This is the final step for ideation, user flow. This user flow was
            created based on a task for Wayne which is book a trip to Paris.
            This process allowed me to document his experience with the app and
            how was he made his decisions to complete his task.

            <li>Many choices of travel package</li>
            <li>Needs description text under icons</li>
            <li>Needs step guides</li>
            <li>Activity selections are very flexible</li>
            <li>More detail about activity's info and hours</li>

          <h3>Suggested Future Improvement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add premium plan that allows users to earn points from trips and
              user can use them to book free activities.
            </li>
            <li>Micro interactions.</li>
            <li>
              Design a reminder to tell when is the best time to get to the
              airport
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This was one of my very first projects when I started UI/UX. This
            challenge helped me to develop my skills in terms of running market
            research, collecting and analyzing data, planning the logical
            structure of an app, and design. In the future in my available time,
            I will run through the process again and again to make the app
            better for millions of wanderers out there.
